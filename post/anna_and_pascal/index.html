<h2 id="who-we-are">Who we are</h2>

<p>We are Anna and Pascal, an Italian-Swiss couple ready to leave Europe for a while. We are both geoscientists and met at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology - ETH Zurich, where we both recently completed a PhD. Anna focuses on the transport of sediment in alpine rivers, Pascal investigates debris-covered glaciers. Also if you never saw a glacier: in this blog you will find nice pictures and hopefully interesting information on these and other amazing places.</p>

<h2 id="where-we-come-from">Where we come from</h2>

<!-- ![Example image](/images/Rotzoresize.jpg) -->

<p>Anna comes from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/bsBb1PrdPg72">Rotzo</a>, a nice mountain village located on an elevated plain in northeastern Italy, Veneto Region. The only little city close by is called Asiago, famous as a recreation area for summer and winter sports and for its special <a href="http://www.caseificiopennar.it/prodotti.htm">cheeses</a>, like &ldquo;tosela&rdquo;. It might be because it is made with milk from local farmers, including Anna&rsquo;s uncle Antonio, or because we had it on our first date, but we really love it!</p>

Pascal grew up in <a href="https://s.geo.admin.ch/7b567f7e5f">Rutschwil</a>, a small village close to the city of Winterthur in northeastern Switzerland. The pretty landscape surrounding it&rsquo;s characterised by agricultural areas, forests and other villages, embedded in smooth hills shaped by past ice age glaciers. <br/></p>

<h2 id="where-we-move-to">Where we move to</h2>

<p>Supported by the <a href="http://p3.snf.ch/project-178420">Swiss National Research Foundation (SNF)</a>, Pascal has the opportunity to work for a couple of years on Alaskan glaciers at the University of Alaska. And Anna too! Therefore, we are soon moving to <a href="https://www.explorefairbanks.com/">Fairbanks, Alaska</a>!!!</p>

<p>Lots of questions have raised in our minds:<br/>
Will we feel too-far and lost in such a remote and big country?<br/>
Will it get real dark in summer when sunrise follows sunset by about two hours only? Will we be able to sleep with 24-hours of daylight? And will we maintain a good mood with only few sunlight hours in winter?<br/>
Does it really get to -40°C? How is actually living at -40°C? Are we really going to wear those pair of shorts that we are planning to pack? Are there really so many mosquitos in summer?<br/>
And what about bears? Will we hang around with bear-spray always ready in our pocket? Or will we ever even see one of them?</p>

<p>With this blog we want to fill the white space on our imaginary map and try to get to the bottom of these questions in the coming months. You are warmly invited to follow us on our little adventures by reading our very-irregularily published blog posts.</p>
