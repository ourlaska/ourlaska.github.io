      <description>Every travel-adventure starts with packing How does your luggage look like when leaving your home for two years and your new domicile is on another continent, with an ocean in between? To start with, do we actually have enough suitcases? Thanks to Anna&amp;rsquo;s cousin Michela and her family we were provided with a sufficent number of baggages (they are really great, Michela!). Nevertheless, our belongings must be condensed to what is essentially needed.</description>

      <description>Who we are We are Anna and Pascal, an Italian-Swiss couple ready to leave Europe for a while. We are both geoscientists and met at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology - ETH Zurich, where we both recently completed a PhD. Anna focuses on the transport of sediment in alpine rivers, Pascal investigates debris-covered glaciers. Also if you are not interested in what river bring transport or you never saw a glacier: in this blog you will find nice pictures and hopefully interesting information on these topics and other amazing places.</description>
